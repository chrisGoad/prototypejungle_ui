PrototypeJungle
===============

Prototype-based diagramming
via persistence for JavaScript's prototype realm. See
[https://prototypejungle.org](https://prototypejungle.org).

This GitHubb repo contains the PrototypeJungle [base directory](https://prototypejungle.org/doc/code.html#codeWork): a collection of prototype structures
for diagramming - visual elements such as arrows, and "kits" for generating diagrams such as trees.
[Another github repository](https://github.com/chrisGoad/prototypetrees) holds
the core JavaScript implementation of the prototype structures.
See [here](https://prototypejungle.org/persistence.html) for general information about the technology
