For more complex images, such as the one at the top of this note, the descriptions that underlie their phenomena will be more complex too, and only partially available to introspection. Nonetheless, it is a coherent hypothesis that these complex descriptions will be found to share a mathematical nature with their simpler counterparts when and if we gain access to them. One way this conclusion could be drawn is via the outside view of the neuroscientist, who might discover codes for such descriptions in underlying neural activity. This positive result will possible  only if patterned phenomena are found to be supervenient on the neural, at least in their structural aspect (qualia may well escape this net). Needless to say such developments are at best a distant prospect.
