<p>
Diagrams naturally incorporate prototype structure,
and prototype trees provide 
a uniform method for  representing this structure in persistent form .
Thus, the technology provides uniform support for
the programming task of constructing and saving diagrams. This uniformity is crucial to
building  an open repository.
</p>
<p>
In addition, ProtoPedia exposes the prototype
