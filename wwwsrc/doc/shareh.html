<div class="pageTitle">Sharing Your Work</div>
 
<p>To share your work, create a catalog at top level called "public.catalog" or "stablePublic.catalog".
If you use the latter name, you are indicating that you believe the catalog contents are suitable for long-term use by
others in the ProtoPedia community. In this case, the catalog and the code on which it depends will be reviewed, and suitable parts copied into a stable repository.</p>
<p>
All such contributions (for which much gratitude will be due) will be credited using the name and profile link that you have entered on your
account page. Please consider including an email address on your account page, enabling communications about your contributions - for example
subsequent upgrades that you might implement to your catalog.</p>

<p>Catalogs named public.catalog will also be credited, and will appear on the catalogs page with a warning as to potential instability.</p>
