  <p class="ideaP">ProtoPedia is an <b>open platform</b> in a sense that goes beyond  being open source, which it is.  A cloud programming environment is provided to allow  JavaScript programmers anywhere to add their own content (visual elements and diagram types) for use by non-programmers, without disturbing the underlying code base. </p>
   

  <!--
  <p style="font-size:18pt;text-align:center"><b>A Future Project: the ProtoPedia</b></p>

 <p class="ideaP">
  As a consequence of this open architecture, it is natural 
 to consider  the project of developing and managing an open catalog of prototype trees representing visual elements and diagram types, without restriction on use, and with wide contribution.ProtoPedia constitutes the only current means for making use of such a library, but the format for representing prorotype trees is well defined, and there is a potential that other applications could exploit the library.</p>
 <p class="ideaP"> At this early stage,the machinery for contribution is already present, but not yet for organization or management. </p>-->
