Code organization.
 In gen0, there are bases, such as drop0,grid0, etc. each of these returns a funcxtion that adds methods, and itself imports and applies basic method addedrs such as /gen0/animation.js','/gen0/basics.js','/gen0/topRandomMethods.js'.  Pure method adders are held in /mlib. gen2 contains the final code for image generation. Each gen2 file might call directly on gen0 bases. Sometimes, several gen2 files might use similar infrastructure. Such infrastructure is placed in gen1.
