<p><b>Notes for beta testers.</b></p>

<p>Firefox: not yet. The new module system for JavaScript, upon which I rely, has been slow to show up in Firefox, so you'll have to use one of the other modern browsers: Chrome, Edge, or Safari.</p>

<p>Only the user interface is ready for testing. The coding side of things will be left for a little later. By all means have
a look at the code and catalog editors if you like,  and let me know of any problems - but I haven't done my own careful pass through these.</p>

<p>I am very interested in bugs,  but workability and comprehensibility of the prototype scheme is also a major issue. Do prototypes, as
I explain them, make sense to you? What's hard or confusing about making or editing a diagram by these methods?</p>

<p>This is the approach to testing that I would advise.</p>

<p>(1) Register for an account, via "sign in". As you'll see, I'll need to send you a key. Let me know of any hitches in this process.</p>

<p>(2) Go through the tutorial, trying all the suggested things. Anything that could be clarified?</p>

<p>(3) Here are two diagrams to construct as exercises:</p>

</p>
<p>(the image of Penelope is from http://imagediver.org/images/e244d69/primaticcio_penelope/snap/1.jpg)</p> <p>and</p>

<p>

For the second, you can use
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/draw.html?source=(sys)/exercise/tree0.item">this</a> as a starting point.
</p>
<p>In both cases, similar things (eg all the blue squares, and the two gates) should share a prototype.
<p>Please stash results at beta/penelope.item and beta/tree.item</p>

<p>Also: play around!</p>

<p>Anything you can tell me about confusions, awkwardness in the interface, and of course, bugs will be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>-Chris
