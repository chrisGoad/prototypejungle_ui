<p><b>Diagrammatic Elements</b></p>
  
<p>So far, you have seen how how to build diagrams by hand from relatively simple elements like circles and arrows.
But {{projectName}} allows for more complex kinds of elements - complete diagrams, with specialized
operations which support accelerated construction.
For example, consider the tree diagram:

<img id="tree" width = "100" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/project-5150272850535855811.appspot.com/o/twitter%3A14822695%2FforCatalog%2Ftree.svg?alt=media"/>

Another, more general sort of diagram is the network diagram - in which nodes are joined by connectors.  

<p><b>Multi-connectors</b>. Addition of  connectors with more than one input or output
requires a different procedure than applies to the simpler binary connectors, such
as arrows or lines. To add a multi connector, drag it to the desired position, and also drag its inputs and outputs so that they are
adjacent 
to the vertices where a connections are desired. The inputs and outputs need not be placed exactly.
Then  "connect multi" operation invoked from  the
left hand panel will effect the connection (and will automatically move the inputs and outputs to the exact positions for connection).
This connect multi option will appear whenever a multi connector is selected.</p>

<p><b>Exercise:</b> Select the multi-connector, then click "connect multi" in the left panel. Drag the circles and square around,
and observe that the connection has been made.</p>

<p<b>Changing the current connector</B> The connector that appears between newly connected items is displayed at the top
of the left hand panel (the "current connector"). If you wish to change the current connector,
drag your connector of choice from the
insert/replace panel  and  drop it on the current connector.
You may need to bring up the insert/replace panel with a click on the top bar. <b>Exercise:</b>Change the connector  to
<img  height="5px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/project-5150272850535855811.appspot.com/o/twitter%3A14822695%2FforCatalog%2FwavyLine.svg?alt=media"/>
Insert some circles, and connect them.</p>

<p>Resize handles only appear over vertices whose appearance in the graphics panel is sufficiently large to accomodate them.
If you wish to resize a small vertex, simply zoom in until the resizer appears. </p>
