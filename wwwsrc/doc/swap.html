  <p  class="ideaP">The catalog contains prototypes of shapes and diagrams. Catalog entries can be inserted into the workspace, or swapped in for  the prototypes of compatible items. The swapping operation involves  "prototype surgery", which is
  the central mechanism of the machine. This is an open platform (or will be shortly, after our beta test): developers everywhere will be able to create their own catalogs of shapes and diagrams. </p>
  
  <p>The swap machine is based on <a href="https://protopedia.org">ProtoPedia</a> technology</p>
