<p>The Prototype Project</p>

<p>The aim of the project is
to build up an open library of visual elements and diagram types represented by  prototype trees, without restriction
on use. ProtoPedia constitutes the current means for making use of this library, but the formalism for representing components is well defined, and there is a potential that other applications could exploit the library.

<p>At this early stage, this is only an announcement of intent. If you are interested in contributing, please contact
