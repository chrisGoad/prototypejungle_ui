<div class="pageTitle">Beta Test</div>
<p>Scope: The objective is to test 1) the user interface, 2) building diagrams from data, and 3) building
diagrams in code.  Input on any one of these areas will be much appreciated, so there is no need
to be a programmer to do testing.</p>

<p></p>Extension of the reposititory by adding new visual elements and diagram types will be left for a later phase of testing. </p>

<p>Suggested testing approach:</p>
<ol>
<li> Sign in/register (the options are to sign in with your Google, Twitter, Facebook, or GitHub account, or with email and password)</li>

<li>Go through the tutorial, and follow all suggestions to "try this".</li>

<li>When signed in, make a diagram (as simple as you like - just a few circles for example) and then save it. Also save it as SVG.
In doing so, you will be using ProtoPedia's file explorer. Try other operations : open, create folder, delete.</p>


<p>For those comfortable with JSON:</p>


<li style="padding-bottom:20px">  Build the following simple diagram from data (by dragging the graph from the
"diagram types" tab in the catalog, saving as your own item, and then modifying data and rebuilding from data.)</li>
<p></p><img width="200" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/project-5150272850535855811.appspot.com/o/JHtAs2VsGjYCqJmOo39SexGq2Fx1%2Fintro%2Fbeta_data.svg?alt=media"/></p>

<li>JavaScript programmers, produce the diagram just below. All arrows should share one  prototype, and so should all circles.</li>

<p style="padding-bottom:20px">Looking at example code should be sufficient - no need to read the whole coding guide.</p>

<li>Producing this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meander_(art)">meander</a> is only slightly more work: </li>

<li> Note that once something has been produced by code it (or data) can be saved as an item and then modified in the UI, yielding in a half-minute, for example:</li>

<li> Play around! Build any diagrams that you might find interesting. Include images and text</li>

</ol>
<p>These kinds of reports will be useful: 1) Bugs encountered (of course) 2) Points of confusion or difficulty: a) in functionality 
b) in documentation.  3) Suggested enhancements. Please include your ProtoPedia user name in any communications.</p>

<p>Please send reports and questions to sys@protopedia.org.  If you provide input, and supply an address, we'll send you this T-shirt (specify S,M,L,Xl)
 </p>

<p> Many Thanks!</p>

if you are not a JavaScript coder, it will be very hThe current test is of the <a href="/draw.html">drawing system</a>, not the <a href="/code.html"> coding system</a>.</p>
<p>Suggestions for beta testers: </p>
 
<p> 1) Check signing in and out.  </p>

<p> 2) Do each of the exercises in the <a href="/doc/choosedoc.html">tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>4) Make this diagram from scratch: </p>
<div style="display:inline-block;padding-left:10px;background-color:white;border:solid thin black">
      <a href="/edit.html?source=(twitter:14822695)/forMainPage/gates2.item">

      <img height="120px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/project-5150272850535855811.appspot.com/o/twitter%3A14822695%2FforMainPage%2Fgates2.svg?alt=media"/>
      </a>
</div>
<p>
Make sure that the two paths to the dreamer are clones (that is, that the two text items "True Dream", "False Dream" are clones -
as are the top and bottom arrow, and top and bottom "Gates of .." text items). Save the diagram.
</p>

<p> 5) Try connecting different kinds shapes to each other in as many combinations  as you can stand (eg shaded circle to lozenge text box, etc),
using all kinds of connectors. Move the connected shapes around, and make sure the connectors follow. Save results.</p>
</p>

<p> 6) Try other things, any other things.</p>
