I sent this to RICHARDS ELECTRICAL SOLUTIONS LLC in Santa Fe, on 2/6/22

The electrical equipment which runs my well has failed. It is housed in an enclosed shop building.  The equipment is very old (66 years). So, the job is to replace the entire setup, including breaker panels. I have another well on the neighboring property which I can go to for water, but still, it is inconvenient to be without running water in my house.  So, I was hoping you could schedule the job for the near future.
