<p><b>Prototypes</b></p>
   <p>In case you're curious: this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_graph" target="_top">Cayley diagram</a> of the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_group" target="_top">dihedral group</a> D3 - the symmetries of an isolateral triangle. </p>
 
<p>Try clicking on one of the circles.
As a consequence, its own properties and those of its prototype  are displayed in two boxes in the right-hand panel.
All of the circles are derived from the same prototype. Prototypes are a core feature of JavaScript, but you don't need to be
a programmer to understand them, nor to use ProtoPedia.
Here is a <a href="/doc/inherit.html" target="_top">programming-free explanation.</a></p>

<p>Having selected a circle,  if you edit the fill property of the
prototype, all circles with the same prototype change color, whereas editing the fill of the  "selected item" affects only the circle you selected.
Note that you can drag the circles around, and resize them. In both cases, arrows are adjusted accordingly.<!--If you zoom in on a selected circle, and then select it,a resizer appears, and
you can modify the circle size with a drag on the resizer. (Resizers only appear for shapes that appear big enough in the graphics).-->
By default, the
prototype is resized, but you can also resize individual circles, by checking the "Adjusting this" check box at the top of the "Selected item"
panel. </p>


<p> The arrows  are  also derived from a common prototype. <b>Exercise:</b>Try selecting an arrow and adjusting it.</p>


<p><b>Replacement</b>: Clicking on "replace" brings up a catalog of visual elements  at the right of the screen.
Dragging an element from the catalog over the element to be replaced, and then dropping, effects the replacement.
Try replacing a circle with a square. Replace prototype in the top bar has a similar effect,
but replaces all items sharing the prototype with the target of the drop.</p>

<p>Different items have different roles and only items with compatible roles allow replacement. As you drag over them, replaceable items will be highlighted. Arrows can be replaced by other connectors, but not by, eg, squares. </p>
