<p><b>More operations for prototypes</b></p>
<p>Two primitives fill out the set of operations available for inspecting and manipulating prototype structure.</p>
<p><b>Show Cohort.</b>
A "cohort" is a set of items that share the same prototype. If you select the item labeled A, and then click "Show Cohort", each item in A's cohort
will be highlighted. Try it, and investigate the cohort structure of the other items as well.
</p>

<p><b>Separate</b> prunes an individual item from its cohort: it copies both the instance and prototype aspects of the item, and leaves it in
a cohort where it is the only member. Try separating item A, and see how the cohort structure is modified.</p>


<p>Here is a <a style="cursor:pointer" onclick="jumpTo('ops.html')">graphical summary</a> of the prototype operations.</p>

<!--<p>Being unfamiliar, these operations may take a little time to get used to. So, an
<a href="/draw.html?source=(sys)/intro/exercise0.item&intro=exercise" target="_top">exercise</a> has been provided.</p>-->
