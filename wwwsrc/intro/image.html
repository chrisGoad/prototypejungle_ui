<p><b>Text and Images</b></p>
<p>Images (jpgs, pngs, gifs, or svgs)  and text can be added to most shapes and boxes, and text can be added to connectors as well. (Also an image or pieces of text can added without the enclosing box via the "image" and "text" items in the catalog under the shape tab.)  To add text or an image to an item, first
select the item, and then the menu in the left panel will enable either or both of the "Add Image" and "Add Text"
buttons, according to the operations supported on that item. If you are adding an image, then you will be prompted for its URL.</p>



<p>
Not every image on the web can be loaded. It depends on the sharing options (CORS) set on the server. For example, every image on WikiPedia/WikiMedia is loadable, and this is true of <a style="cursor:pointer" onclick="jumpTo('https://www.facebook.com')">Facebook</a> and
<a style="cursor:pointer" onclick="jumpTo('https://imgur.com')">Imgur</a> 
 as well,
but the images on Pinterest are not. Another restriction: images do not show up when an item is stored as a jpeg, but do when saved as svg. An svg file is embedable in web pages, just like a jpeg.</p>
</p>

<p><a style="cursor:pointer" onclick="jumpTo('https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode')">Unicode</a> characters (eg &#x1D6BA or &#x1F525 ) may appear  in text. To include them, just  copy and paste them from a unicode source, for example 
<a style="cursor:pointer" onclick="jumpTo('https://unicode-search.net/unicode-namesearch.pl')">https://unicode-search.net/unicode-namesearch.pl</a></p>

<p>Images and text can also be replaced; the appropriate options will appear when you select an item. </p>
<p>Images  without boxes result when you insert an "Image" from the shape tab of the catalog. You are prompted for the URL, and then the image
is added without any surrounding box.</p>
</p>
<p>As an exercise, add the image of Isaac Newton to the the lower box, and the text "Isaac Newton".
https://i.imgur.com/eCez6ad.jpg is
the URL of an image of Newton.</p>
