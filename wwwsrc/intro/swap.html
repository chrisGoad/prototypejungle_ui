<p id="replace"><b>Swap</b></p> <p>The catalog panel to the right, when active, has three modes, selectable by button: insert, swap, and swap prototype. If you select swap mode,
 then dragging an element from the catalog over the element to be replaced, and then dropping, effects the replacement.  Try replacing a circle with a lozenge. Swap Prototype  has a similar effect, but replaces all items sharing the prototype of the target of the drop  -
(the "cohort" of the target as 
defined <a style="cursor:pointer" onclick="jumpTo('draw.html?source=(sys)/intro/separate.item&intro=separate&fit=0.8')">here</a>).
On the left is the result of swapping the prototype of the shaded circle <img width="30" 
     src="{{sys}}forMainPage%2Fshaded.svg?alt=media"/> for that of the circle:</p>

<img width="150" 
     src="{{sys}}forMainPage%2Fswap6.svg?alt=media"/>
<img width="150" 
     src="{{sys}}intro%2Fswap6.svg?alt=media"/>

<p> On the right is the result of two prototype swaps: spiral for circle, and curved-line arrowhead  for solid arrowhead.</p></P>


<p>Different items have different roles and only items with compatible roles allow replacement. As you drag over them, replaceable items will be highlighted. Arrows can be replaced by other connectors, but not by, eg, squares. Sometimes, the role of a part of an element is what is matched - this enables, eg
replacing the head of an arrow  (try it).</p>
