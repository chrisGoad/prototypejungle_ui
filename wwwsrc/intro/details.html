<p><b>Multi-connectors</b>. Addition of  connectors with more than one input or output
requires a different procedure than applies to the simpler binary connectors, such
as arrows or lines. To add a multi connector, drag it to the desired position, and also drag its inputs and outputs so that they are
adjacent 
to or within the nodes where a connections are desired. The inputs and outputs need not be placed exactly.
When the multi connector is selected,  the "Multi Connect" operation will appear in the left hand panel, and invoking
it will effect the connection (and will automatically move the inputs and outputs to the exact positions for connection).
</p>

<p><b>Exercise:</b> Select the multi-connector, then click "Multi Connect" in the left panel. Drag the circles and square around,
and observe that the connection has been made.</p>
