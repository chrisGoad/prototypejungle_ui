<p><b>The Idea</b></p>
 <p>
  A <a href="https://medium.com/dailyjs/prototype-trees-as-javascript-components-fad6c8fb4454" target="_top">prototype tree</a> is a new kind of JavaScript component which is well suited to  the task of representing diagrams. So represented,  diagrams are manipulated via operations on their underlying prototype structure. Much flexibility results, particularly in  <a href="#replace">swapping</a> out elements for others with equivalent functionality. {{ProjectName}} includes both a UI and an API; diagrams produced by code can be manipulated in the UI, and vice-versa.<!-- underlying of the underlying prototype structure,It enables uniform and flexible treatment of diagrams
  in  the user interface and the API via manipulations of underlying prototype structure, and by retaining that structure when diagrams are  saved.-->
  The basic operations
  are illustrated
  by example just below, as implemented in the UI. <!--The flexibility of the swap operations is particularly notable. -->  </p>
  <!--
  A diagram normally
  consists of a set of "marks" such as circles  and arrows that are derived from common <a href="/doc/inherit.html" target="_top">prototypes</a>.
 The prototype tree
  that represents a diagram reflects
  this structure directly, and the user interface gives access to it. This representation enables uniform implementation of
  the basic operations required for diagrams: construction, external storage, editing parameters of visual elements, and replacing elements with new variants with equivalent functionality (working examples appear just below).
  <!--The
  basic operations on prototype trees
  are just those that are needed for diagramming (see below).--></p>
 <p>
  ProtoPedia is an <b>open platform</b> in a sense that goes beyond  being open source, which it is.  A cloud programming environment is provided to allow  JavaScript programmers anywhere to build diagrams, and introduce new kinds of visual elements
  into the catalogs - and create entirely new diagram types, all for use by non-programmers.  Programmers can add content without disturbing the underlying code base. <!--This is possible because of the underlying uniformity of the representation and its operations.-->
 </p>

 <p id="replace"> <b>Swap</b> You can replace the circles with squares by: square by 1) clicking "swap prototype" on the topbar,
 2) dragging a square from the right hand panel over any circle. All the details for use of the interface can be found in our short tutuorial.</p>
