<p><b>Inserting.</b> A catalog of visual elements appears at the right
of the screen.
Elements are inserted by dragging them into the graphics panel. Once inserted, you can select an item by clicking on it.
When you select an  item, the catalog is replaced by a property-editing
panel for the selected item. You can also resize the selected item, and drag it around.  You can always bring back the catalog by clicking "Insert"  in the top bar.</p>
<p><b>Replacing.</b> Clicking on "replace" in the top bar puts the catalog in replace mode. 
  In this  mode, dragging the replacing element over the element to be replaced, and then dropping, effects the replacement. Different
items have different roles  and only items with compatible roles allow replacement.
 As you drag over them,
replaceable items will be highlighted.  If you drag a simple shape (such as a lozenge or circle) over a  text box,
it is the box, not the text, that
will be replaced - because of the compatibility of roles.  Using this method, all simple shapes can be swapped in  as the "box" in a text box.</p>
<!--But you can also select the element from the catalog,
and then drag out a box in the graphics panel with the desired dimensions (this is convenient for things like arrows).
Most are resizable: click on the catalog
entry of interest, then drag out a box in the graphics panel for inserting that element with the desired dimensions. You can tell if an insertee is resizable by
the kind of cursor that appears over the graphics panel: cross-hair for resizing, plus symbol for a simple drop - that is, addition at a point without resizing.</p>
-->
<p><b>Exercise:</b> Try inserting a few circles, resizing them, and replacing them with other shapes.</p>

<p>"Replace prototype" is just like "Replace", but replaces the prototype of the shape rather than only the shape itself. Prototypes
will be explained in <a href="/edit.html?source=/diagram/cayleyD3.js&intro=prototypes" target="__top">a moment</a>.

<p><b>Resizing</b>
Resize handles only appear over elements whose appearance in the graphics panel is sufficiently large to accomodate them.
If you wish to resize a small element, simply zoom in until the resizer appears. </p>
