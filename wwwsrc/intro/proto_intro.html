  <p> JavaScript (a foundation of the web) uses <b><a style="cursor:pointer" onclick="jumpTo('doc/inherit.html')">prototypes</a></b> to organize 
  objects by their structure. <!--(other languages use classes for similar purposes)-->
  In PrototypeJungle, this organization is exposed in the interface,  rather than being hidden behind the scenes, 
  allowing  the interface to take a very simple form.
  The approach provides simplicity for the user, but also for the programmer who wishes to add new visual elements.  
  <!--Note that,  for kit-built diagrams, the prototype grouping
  is built for you.--></p>
  
  <p>The essence of the interface is explained in this one page.</p>
  
  <p> When you select (click on) a circle, the right hand panel shows its  properties, which you can edit.  
  The circles can be resized and dragged around as well.</p>
  <p>Note that there are two sets of properties, one labeled "instance" and the other "prototype". Each of the circles
  is derived from a common prototype, and you can edit either the prototype, affecting all of the circles,
  or just the particular circle that you have selected. (The same goes for the arrows.) </p>
  <p>Exercise: Try setting the fills (interior colors) first of a circle prototype, then of the instance, using different colors.
  You will see that setting a property value for the instance overrides the value held by the prototype (signaled by an asterisk next
  to the property in question)</p>
  
  <p>How to use the <span style="color:red">color</span>  <span style="color:blue">widget</span>: select a color in the vertical bar, and a shade of that color in the square, then click choose.
  You can also enter a name of a color or an rgb value in the text box</p>
  <p> The "Adjusting this" check box controls whether resizing applies to the
 instance or the prototype.
