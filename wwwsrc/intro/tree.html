<p><b>Diagram Types</b></p>
<p>In the default catalog, you will see a tab named "diagram type". Anything that you drag from that tab serves as a seed for diagrams of that
type, which you can modify into the desired form via its specialized operations, or building a variant from data, or via any of the standard operations
such as swapping that apply to any diagram.</p>
<p> First let us consider the tree diagram type, the seed of which appears in the graphics panel. </p>
<p>Note that the tree is built from data (click on the "data" button on the topbar). You can modify the data, and rebuild the tree, following the procedures
outlined in the next section.</p>
<p> But trees also come with specialized operations in the interface. Click on a circle. Note that the left-hand panel displays, among other things,
the option "Add Child" - a specialized option for this type of diagram.  Click on this option, and 
a child node will be added under the selected node. The "Reposition Subtree" operation can be used at any
time to  position the nodes  in a way that avoids overlap. Circles can be dragged too and their subtrees come along.
the tree shape can be adjusted by hand.

</p>
<p> Try building a tree that looks like this:</p>

<p>(Hint: use reposition subtree, and add text, for the top node, then finish with a "swap prototype")
