<p><b>Connections</b>.
{{ProjectName}} has support for diagrams in which shapes or text boxes are connected by lines or arrows. In this sort
of diagram, some items are "nodes" and some are "connectors" (and some are neither). Elements of the shape catalog are flagged as to
which role they play (eg circles, rectangles, and text boxes of various kinds are nodes, and lines and arrows are connectors). If you insert
and select something with the node role, the left hand panel will show an option to "connect". If you click connect, and then select
another node, an arrow from the first to the second item  will appear. If you subsequently drag the nodes around, the
arrow will be adjusted to maintain the connection. Subsequently, arrows may be replaced by any element with the connector role. </p>
<p><b>Exercise:</b> Connect A to B, B to C, and C back to A. (Start by selecting A, then clicking "connect" in the left hand panel,
and then clicking B. You should see an arrow appear). Note that if you drag any of the circles around, the arrows follow.

</p>

Next, click "Replace Prototype" in the top bar, and drag and drop a wavy line over one of the arrows.  The connections will now be wavy lines, since all arrows are derived from the same prototype. You should end up with something that looks like
this:
