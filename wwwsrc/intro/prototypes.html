 <p><b>What is a prototype, exactly?</b></p>
 
 
 <p>Each circle in this example was derived from a common template called its prototype. Click on a circle.
 As mentioned <a href="/draw.html?source=(sys)/intro/prototypes.item&intro=properties&fit=0.75" target="_top">earlier</a>, you will see two boxes in the edit panel to the right, one for the particular circle you have clicked (the "instance"),
 and one for the prototype.</p>
 <p>Circles B and C inherit their fill (interior color) from
 the prototype (<span style="color:blue">blue</span>), but for A, this property 
 has been overriden  (<span style="color:red">red</span>).
 Click on circle A. You will note that only one of the instance properties appears with an asterisk: its fill.  The asterisk means
 "overriden". </p>
 
 <p>You can modify the color of A to yellow by changing the fill property of its instance. (How to use the color widget: select a color in the vertical bar, <i>and</i> a shade of that color in the square, <i>then</i> click choose.  You can also enter a name of a color or an rgb value in the
 text box)</p>
 
 <p> Now try editing the fill of the prototype. Note that this affects both B and C, but not A, since B and C inherit color from the prototype,
 but A does not.</p>
 
<!-- <p><b>Cohort</b> The items which inherit from a common prototype are called a cohort. So, all of our circles belong to one cohort, as you can see by clicking
 on a circle, and then "show  cohort" in the left panel.</p-->
