<p> The catalog panel is the area on the right side of the screen from which you drag items for insertion/swap.
Initially the contents of this panel are taken entirely from a shared source, the
global catalog.</p>
<p>However, you can build your own catalog, simply by saving any item in the folder <i>/catalog/</i>, or in a subfolder
<i>/catalog/&lt;whatever&gt;</i>.
Then, the next time you start up {{projectName}}, you will see the item under the tab
 <i>(.c)</i> or <i>(.c)/&lt;whatever&gt;</i> (resp.), where it can be used in insertions and swaps. If you are a JavaScript programmer, you can code your own new elements and place them
in your catalog - by saving the JavaScript-built elements to a catalog directory from the code editor.
See the <a href="/doc/code.html" target="_top">coding guide</a>.  </p>

<p>If you'd like to share your work, place it in the <i>exports</i> directory. You yourself will have access to
its contents under tabs (.x) or (.x)/&lt;whatever&gt;</i>. But so will other people, if they know your user name, controlled by their config file
/config.json (accessible at top level from the file pulldown). Initial contents of config.json:
</p>
<pre style="font-size:9pt">
{
"catalogs":
  "sys/*,.exports/*,.catalog/*"
}
</pre>

This can be edited to, for example
<pre style="font-size:9pt">
{
"catalogs":
  "sys/*,.exports/*,.catalog/*,someUserName/*
}
</pre>
<p>
After this edit, the tab (someUserName) will appear in the catalog panel. When this tab is selected, the contents
of that user's exports directory will appear, ready to be dragged in. If the exports directory in question contains
subdirectories, tabs of the form (someUserName)/someDir will appear.
If only the subdirectory is wanted, and not the rest of someUser's exports, then config file should look like this:
</p>
<pre style="font-size:9pt">
{
"catalogs":
  "sys/*,.exports/*,.catalog/*,someUserName/someDir"
}
</pre>
<p>
More than one exports subdirectory, and more than one user, can be indicated in this manner.
Of course, you can edit your own config file to access other people's exports. Generally, only the content indicated
in the config file will appear in your catalog panel.</p>
