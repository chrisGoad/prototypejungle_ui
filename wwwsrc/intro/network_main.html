<p>A <b>network diagram</b> is a free-form collection of nodes connected by arrows which you populate "by hand".</p> 
<p><b>Inserting.</b> A catalog of visual elements appears at the right
of the screen.
Elements are inserted by dragging them into the graphics panel. Once inserted, you can select an item by clicking on it.
When you select an  item, the catalog is replaced by a property-editing
panel for the selected item and its <a href="/draw.html?source=/diagram/cayleyD3.js&intro=prototypes" target="_top">prototype</a>. You can also resize the selected item, and drag it around.  You can always bring back the catalog by clicking "Insert"  in the top bar.</p>
<p><b>Connecting.</b>First, insert a few circles (or other shapes). New connections can be added in the following way: select any of the shapes. Note that "connect" appears as an option in the action menu on the left side of the screen. Click on connect, then select another shape.
An arrow connecting the shapes will appear. The kind of connector can be changed with "replace" or "replace prototype". Try dragging
the shapes around, or resizing them. Note that the arrows follow along. There are multi-connectors too, of the kind seen in the example just below. <a href="/draw.html?source=(sys)/intro/details.item&intro=details" target="_top"> Here</a> are the details. </p>

<!--But you can also select the element from the catalog,
and then drag out a box in the graphics panel with the desired dimensions (this is convenient for things like arrows).
Most are resizable: click on the catalog
entry of interest, then drag out a box in the graphics panel for inserting that element with the desired dimensions. You can tell if an insertee is resizable by
the kind of cursor that appears over the graphics panel: cross-hair for resizing, plus symbol for a simple drop - that is, addition at a point without resizing.</p>
