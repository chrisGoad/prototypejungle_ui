<div style="padding:0px;margin:0px">
<p><b>Wrap and Unwrap</b></p>

<p>Click on any line of the either box. Notice that the whole box is selected. Even so, the boxes are made up
of  four lines each. This is because the boxes are "wrapped". The wrapping can be disabled by clicking "unwrap" in the top bar. After unwrapping, primitive
constituents of all items will be individually selectable, and editable.</p>

<p>In fact, the top box is in its original state as it arrived from the catalog,
and the bottom box is a copy in which the properties of the consitituent lines have been modified. <b>Exercise</b>: unwrap, and then turn the top line of the top box
green.</p>
