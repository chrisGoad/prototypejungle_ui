<p><b>General Kit Advice</b></p>
<p>You don't need to know much in detail about PrototypeJungle's capabilities to use kits, only a few things:</p>
<p>
If you select (click on) any part  of the kit, the options that apply to the kit appear in the menu at the left. One option will be, 
for each kit, "Select Kit Root". After clicking "Select Kit Root", the properties of the kit as whole will appear in the 
<i>right</i> hand panel, where they can edited. 
Editing properties is explained on <a style="cursor:pointer" onclick="jumpTo('draw.html?source=(sys)/forMainPage/three_circles.item&intro=properties&fit=0.7')">this page</a> of the  tutorial. 
</p>
<p>Text can be edited by selecting the text in question, and then clicking on "Edit Text" on the left menu.</p>
<p>If images are of interest, you might want to have a look at the

them in jpeg or svg form (where they can be accessed via URL, or embedded in web pages) is done in a conventional way, and 
the few details are  <a style="cursor:pointer" onclick="jumpTo('draw.html?intro=files')">here</a> <span style="color:red"> You need to be signed in to save your  work!</span></p>

<p><b>How to Build a  Ring</b> </p>The kit properties are "numSegments", "innerRadius", "outerRadius", "textRadius", and "indentDepth".  Choose the numSegments that you want first.
