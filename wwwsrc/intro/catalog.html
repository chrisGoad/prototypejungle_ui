<p><b>Catalogs and Subdiagrams</b></p>
<p> The catalog panel is the area on the right side of the screen from which you drag items for insertion/swap.
Initially the contents of this panel are taken entirely from a shared source, the
global catalog.</p>
<p>However, you can build your own catalog, simply by saving any item in the folder <i>/catalog/</i>, or in a subfolder
<i>/catalog/&lt;whatever&gt;</i>.
Then, the next time you start up {{projectName}}, you will see the item under the tab
 <i>(.c)</i> or <i>(.c)/&lt;whatever&gt;</i> (resp.), where it can be used in insertions. If you are a JavaScript programmer, you can code your own new elements and place them
in your catalog - by saving the JavaScript-built elements to a catalog directory from the code editor.
See the <a style="cursor:pointer" onclick="jumpTo('doc/code.html#catalogs')">coding guide</a>.  </p>



<p>Catalogs allow you to build diagrams which contain other diagrams as parts. These subdiagrams by default
appear as units, which can be resized and moved, but whose parts are inaccessible. However, the unwrap operation
(see next section) provides access to the parts of subdiagrams.</p>
