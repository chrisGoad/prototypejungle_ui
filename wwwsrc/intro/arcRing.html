<p><b>How to Build a  Ring</b> </p><p>The properties of this kit
 as whole are "numSegments", "radiusRatio", "textRadiusRatio", "textRadius", and "indentDepth".  Choose the numSegments that you want first. Then edit other kit parameters to taste, and each text. "radiusRatio" is the ratio of the radii of the outside and inside of the ring - that is,
 its thickness. "textRadiusRatio" is how far out to place the text, as a multiple of the outer radius of the ring. You can also modify the  colors of the ring segments, and drag the texts
around (and edit their properties). "Position Texts" puts the texts back into their computed positions. </a> </p>
