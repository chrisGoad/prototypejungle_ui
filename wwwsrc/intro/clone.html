<p><b>Copy</b></p>
<p>When you select an
element, the copy button in the left hand panel will be enabled. After clicking "copy",
you can add a series of copies of the selected element with clicks in the graphics panel (copy mode
persists until you click "Done Copying" in the left panel). </p>
<p><span style="color:red">Note:</span> copies share the prototype of the original, but are separate as instances.</b></p>
<p><b>Exercise</b>: Try copying and the circle and square, each at least twice, and then resizing one of the circles. Note that
the copied circles are resized too, since the dimension of the circle (at least initially) is in the prototype.</p>
<p><p><span style="color:red">Note:</span>each insert has its own prototype.</p>

<p>A useful style of work in building a diagram is
to first drag in one of each of the kinds of elements wanted (eg one  lozenge, and one rectangle for a flowchart), and
 use copying to generate as many instances of these items as wanted.</p>
