<p> Note that when the circles are dragged or resized with the mouse, the arrows are updated accordingly.</p>
<p>If you have
clicked on one of the circles, its own properties and those of its prototype are displayed in two boxes in the right-hand panel, where they can be
adjusted. Same for the arrows.</p>
<p>A circle can be replaced with, eg, a square by clicking on the "Replace" option in the top bar, and then dragging the square that appears
in the right-hand panel over the circle you wish to replace ("Replace prototype" will replace both circles).
