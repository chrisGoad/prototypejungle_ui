<p><b>How to Build a Family Tree</b> </p>

<p>To get started , click on a parent node to select it. Then, click on 
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Add Child</span>,
and note that the expected thing happens. You can add names and pictures for any person via <span style="text-decoration:underline">Edit Text</span>, 
and <span style="text-decoration:underline">Add Image</span>.  If you select (click on) the child and then <span style="text-decoration:underline">Add Partner</span> (left or right) a partner for the child will be added. To add a child of a couple, select the right partner of the couple, then click 
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Add Child</span>. Undo is always available.</p>

<p>You can control the layout of the tree in two ways. <p>
<p>First, you can drag around families by their little <span style="color:red">red</span> handles.
Try it. Notice that all descendants (to whatever generation) follow along. You can drag individuals too. If an individual has a partner
he/she can only be dragged horizontally. Finally, in terms of dragging, you can drag the junction point
of branching lines up and down, by clicking on those lines, and dragging the little yellow square that appears.
</p>

<p>Second, the menu command "Layout Family" automatically chooses positions for every descendant of the family to which the selected
person belongs, but leaves ancestors alone. As you will see, the automated layout tools will not do the whole job in  complex cases, so 
some hand layout will be needed (hand layout also allows you to get the look you want).</p>
