<div style="padding:0px;margin:0px">
<p><b>Data</b></p>
<p> Some items are built from data, rather than hand-made. This is the case for many of the kits, including this graph kit. So are the
<a style="cursor:pointer" onclick="jumpTo('draw.html?source=/example/cayleyD3.js&intro=cayley')">Cayley
graph</a> and the <a style="cursor:pointer" onclick="jumpTo('draw.html?source=(sys)/forMainPage/navajo.item&fit=0.9')">taxonomy of
Navajo creation</a> which appear as
examples on the home page.  The latter was lightly edited by hand as well.</p>


<p>For data-built
items, the "Data" option in the top bar will be active. Click this option, and the data from which the item was built will appear in the
right hand panel. Currently, all data appears in the <a style="cursor:pointer" onclick="jumpTo('https://www.json.org/')">JSON</a> format. </p>

<p>The data for this graph is: </p>

<pre style="padding-top:11px;font-size:8pt">
{
"vertices":[{"id":"L","position":[-50,0]},
            {"id":"R","position":[50,0]}],
"edges":[{"end0":"L","end1":"R"}]
}
</pre>

<p> For those familiar with JSON this will be self-explanatory. Vertices have ids and positions, and the ends of edges are given by
the ids of vertices.  (This is the form that data takes for graphs; for other items the form is different).
You can always edit the data, and  then rebuild the item. Try setting the position of vertex L to [-50,50], rebuild,
and see what happens. When an item is saved, its data is saved with it.</p>

<p>Edits or swaps of prototypes are preserved by rebuilds from data. Any changes to the instances, however, are lost, because a new
batch of instances is created on each rebuild.</p>

<p>Initially, an items's data is held internally, and saved with the item. However, you will note "save as" and "change source" buttons on
the data panel. These allow associating items with external data files.</p>
