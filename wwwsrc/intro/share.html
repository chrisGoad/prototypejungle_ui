<p>A useful employment of your catalog is to create your own variants of basic elements, such as arrows. In the graphics panel, you see a standard arrow, and, below it,
a variant. The variant was arrived at by taking a standard arrow, and swapping out both head and shaft for entries in the "arrowHead" and "connector" tabs in the catalog, respectively. </
Then the "wavesToSkip" parameter was adjusted from 0 to 2 - to prevent the waves from  overlapping the arrow head. As an exercise, try modifying the standard arrow to match the
variant. To make the variant into a catalog item, start with an empty canvas, add in a standard arrow, modify it, and then save to a catalog directory.  </p>
<p>Try creating some variants of items from the box tab of the catalog.</p>


<p><span style="color:red">Important notes:</span> (1) When constructing items for use in the catalog, new variants, you should always operate on prototypes rather than instances.</p>
