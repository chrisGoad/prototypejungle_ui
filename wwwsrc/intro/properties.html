  <p><b>Properties and Prototypes</b></p>
  
  <p>This page explains the  prototype structures at the heart of the system, and how to access them.</p> 
  
  <p> When you select (click on) a circle, the right hand panel shows its  properties, which you can edit.  
  The circles can be resized and dragged around as well.</p>
  <p>Note that there are two sets of properties, one labeled "instance" and the other "prototype". Each of the circles
  is derived from a common prototype, and you can edit either the prototype, affecting all of the circles,
  or just the particular circle that you have selected. (The same goes for the arrows.) </p>
  <p>Exercise: Try setting the fills (interior colors) first of a circle prototype, then of the instance, using different colors.
  You will see that setting a property value for the instance overrides the value held by the prototype (signaled by an asterisk next
  to the property in question)</p>
  
  <p>How to use the <span style="color:red">color</span>  <span style="color:blue">widget</span>: select a color in the vertical bar, and a shade of that color in the square, then click choose.
  You can also enter a name of a color or an rgb value in the text box</p>
  <p> The "Adjusting this" check box controls whether resizing applies to the
 instance or the prototype.
