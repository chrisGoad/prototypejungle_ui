<p id="replace"><b>Recombination: Swapping Parts.</b></p> <p>Consider the two arrows in the graphics panel. Each is an atomic item in the sense that it is accessed as a whole; clicking on it selects
the entire item. However, it has parts: the shaft and the head.  Swap applies to parts as well. The lower arrow was arrived at by taking a standard arrow, and swapping out both head and shaft for  entries in  the "arrowHead" and "line" tabs in the catalog, respectively. Exercise: make the the upper arrow look like the lower one, via swaps. Such a modification might be called a <i>recombination</i> of the original.</p>

<p>Recombinations can be saved in  your catalog, as we shall see shortly.</p>
