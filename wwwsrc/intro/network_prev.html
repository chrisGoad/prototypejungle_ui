<p><b>Network diagrams.</b>.
A network is a diagram in which shapes or text boxes are connected by lines or arrows. A network can be built  with the methods introduced
so far, since the requisite elements appear in the library. But if any shape is moved, the arrows that connect to it need to be moved by hand, making
editing of the diagram arduous. In the diagram to to the right, note that the arrows are modified automatically when shapes are dragged (Exercise: try it).
New connections can be added in the following way: select any of the circles. Note that "connect" appears as an option in the action menu on the left side
of the screen. Click on connect, then select a circle diagonally across from the current selection. An arrow connecting these circles will then appear.
The kind of connector can be changed with "replace" or "replace prototype". Try replacing an arrow with the wavy line with "replace prototype". You should
see something like this:

<p>You can drag new shapes into the viewing window, and connect them as well. 
To build a network diagram from scratch, select "new network" from
the file menu.</p>
