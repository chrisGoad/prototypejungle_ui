<p><b>How to Build a Bracket (or Tree of Ancestors)</b> </p><p>To enter a new name, just click on the  "name" you wish to enter, and then click "<span style="text-decoration:underline">Edit Text</span>". If you click any blank space over the bracket, the whole
bracket will be selected, and you can resize it, and change its parameters (notably <i>numLevels</i> and <i>textUp</i>). Decide how many levels you want <i>first</i>, then enter names.</p>
<p>To edit the properties of text (such as color or font), select a name. On the right panel two boxes will appear, labeled 
"Instance" and "Prototype". If you modify properties of "Instance" only the name you have selected will be affected, but
modification of properties of the "Prototype" will affect all names. This is explained in greater detail

<p> Saving diagrams, and producing
them in jpg or svg form (where they can be accessed via URL, or embedded in web pages), are general capabilities of PrototypeJungle.
The tutorial page for saving is <a style="cursor:pointer" onclick="jumpTo('draw.html?intro=files')">here</a>.  You can 
deploy all of the diagramming capabilities of PrototypeJungle for your brackets(useful perhaps for adding commentary or arrows). If this is of
