  In this note, I wish to convince you of three things, using a few examples.  First, your perception of an image is a description, not a copy. Second, the nature of that description is often  mathematical in nature. Finally , I wish to show that the patterns  that you see lie within your percepts, and should not be thought of as belonging to the outside world. So, to paraphrase <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2017%3A21&version=NKJV">Luke 17:21</a>, <i>the kingdom of pattern is within you.</i>

    0. Terminology

<div class="theGrid">
  <div></div>
  <div class="stdDiv">
    When you gaze at an image, such as the one above, there are two things going on. First there is the image itself as a physical object (in this case an array of pixels on your screen).    Another is the seeing of the image, the image as it appears to you. The former is a physical thing, and the latter a mental thing. (Perhaps the mental thing emerges from the physical thing that is your brain, but it is still of a different character and structure than the image itself.) The mental thing is called a phenomenon (plural phenomena), in the jargon of the school of philosophy known as <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/">phenomenology</a>, founded in its modern form by <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/husserl/">Edmund Husserl</a> early in the twentieth century. I will employ this jargon in what follows.

    1. Phenomena arising from images are descriptions, not copies
  </div>
</div>
<div class="theGrid">
  <div></div>
  <div class="stdDiv"> 
Are the left and right images just above different? They are, but this requires study. The phenomena that arise immediately from the two images are identical. In fact there are 69 differences in the angles of lines. This is not apparent because the common phenomenon to which the two images give rise does not contain the orientations of the individual line segments. Instead, the phenomenon is captured by the description “a square grid of randomly oriented white line segments on a field of black”. By randomly is meant: “with no pattern that I can detect”.   This shows clearly that what is in the mind, the phenomenon, has the nature of a description rather than a copy. In this case, the description is quite brief.
 </div>
</div>
<div class="theGrid">
  <div></div>
  <div class="stdDiv" style="padding-top:30">  
A surprising aspect of this situation is that you feel so strongly that the angles of the line segments are present to you , even though they are missing from the phenomenon.
The feeling of presence, and actual presence in phenomena, are two different things. Daniel Dennett calls the former “the representation of presence” and the latter, “the presence of representation”.   See this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsaccadic_memory#Dennett">paragraph</a> for a concise formulation of Dennett’s views.

   2. Phenomena arising from images are mathematical in nature (at least sometimes)

The image above exhibits a pattern of an abstract kind. With a glance, you know all about it. If I asked you to describe it, you would likely come up with something like: “It is a grid with short red horizontal lines at the centers of cells. White lines consisting of the left and top boundaries of grid cells zigzag up and to the right across the grid, but there is also a horizontal band half way down where all four boundaries appear as lines, and a vertical band half way across with the same property. ” All of these aspects are available in your experience of the image within a second or so of seeing it. This is very close to an exact mathematical description of the image, in that it could easily be rendered in mathematical terms by someone with knowledge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry">analytic geometry</a> and in fully formal terms by someone who is also familiar with axiomatic (eg <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory">ZF</a>) set theory. That is, the phenomenon that the image induces in your mind has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure">mathematical structure</a>, and that structure is built immediately upon attending to the image. If this were not the case, no such description would be possible. Note that the phenomenon arising from images 1 and 2 has mathematical structure as well, and its description (“a square grid of randomly oriented white line segments on a field of black”) is a summary which leaves out all detail.

  <div class="stdDiv"> 
Note that I am practicing phenomenology, not psychology, here. The primary technique of phenomenological investigation is to carefully attend to one’s own phenomena exactly as they present themselves. The technique also involves “bracketing”. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracketing_(phenomenology)">Bracketing</a> consists of placing aside any consideration of the external objects which give rise to phenomena, and even of whether there are such external objects. It is not those externals that are the topic of investigation, but the phenomena, just as they are. In considering the phenomenon associated with image 1, I was able to detect its mathematical nature. To do this required some training in mathematics on my part, but the phenomenon in itself has this nature independent of the mathematical training of the individual in which it occurs. The phenomenon must have a mathematical nature for everyone, because everyone can come up with the sort of description that I alluded to, but only those with some mathematical background will detect the description’s mathematical nature.

    3. Patterns as we percieve them exist within phenomena, not in the external world

  <div class="stdDiv"> 
The images 4 and 5 are <i>identical</i> to images 1 and 2, except for the red highlighting . From this we see that patterns of a simple kind were present in the <i>images</i> 1 and 2, but not present in the initial <i>phenomena</i> arising from these images. This makes the simple but important point that the patterns that we see reside within our minds. The presence of a pattern in the outer world, however simple, is no guarantee of its arrival in  phenomena. And when a pattern does show up in a phenomenon it assumes the form of the phenomenon into which it has been absorbed: a  description (such as "a diamond" or a "cross")  rather than pixels. It goes the other way too: patterns can appear in our phenomena that have no counterpart in the external world. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia">apophenia</a>.  So, yes, the kingdom of pattern <i>is</i> within you.
